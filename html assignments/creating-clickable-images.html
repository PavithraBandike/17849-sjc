<body><h1>About Flowers</h1>
    <p>
        Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs â€“ sepals that enclose and protect the developing flower, petals that attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants produce gametes</p>
       <p>Flower is from the Middle English flour, which referred to both the ground grain and the reproductive structure in plants, before splitting off in the 17th century. It comes originally from the Latin name of the Italian goddess of flowers, Flora. The early word for flower in English was blossom,though it now refers to flowers only of fruit trees.
