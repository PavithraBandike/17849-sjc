    <h1>About Comments</h1>
    <!-- This is a comment -->
    <p>In HTML, a comment is a section of text that is not processed by the web browser. Comments are enclosed in
        <!-- --> tags. These tags tell the browser that the text inside them is a comment and should not be rendered on
        the front end.
    </p>
    <!-- Comments are not displayed in the browser -->
    <p>
        With the comments tag, you can leave notes to remind yourself where you left off in the build process. You could
        explain the intended functionality of a section of code for another developer or your future self. Or, you might
        assign someone a task or point out an error for them with a comment.
    </p>
