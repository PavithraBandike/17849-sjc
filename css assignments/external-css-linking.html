    <h2>Introduction </h2>

    <p>External CSS is a form of CSS which is used to add styling to multiple HTML pages at a time. It helps to design
        the layout of many HTML web pages simultaneously. The external CSS is always saved with the .css extension, and
        through this file, we can change the complete style of our HTML web page.</p><br>
    <h2>External CSS</h2>
    <p>It is one of the most commonly used CSS forms for updating, styling, and modifying the distinctive styles in many
        HTML web pages at once. An external style sheet can be called into an HTML document using two methods:

        Using the
        <link> tag in the HTML document head.
        Using a combination of external CSS functions and integrated CSS.
        One of the unique features of external CSS is that we can write an external style sheet in any text editor, but
        it should always be saved with a .css extension, and the file must not contain any HTML elements.

    </p>
    <h2>Advantages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For any change in the styling of an HTML page, a single modification to the style sheet can be applied to
            all the connected pages, resulting in saving time and effort.</li>
            <li>Selector and grouping techniques are used to apply styles under complex contexts.</li>
            <li>It helps to keep our code nice and readable as all the code for the styling part is done in a separate file.</li>
    </ul>
