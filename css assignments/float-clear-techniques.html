       <p> Children themselves tend at first to define friendships in terms of interactions, such as “we play together.”
        Companionship is generally viewed as the primary function of friendship among toddlers and preschoolers.
        Preschool friends have more social contact with each other, talk more with each other, and demonstrate more
        equality and less dominance in their interactions with each other than they do in their interactions with
        nonfriends. Differences between friends and nonfriends are particularly evident in social pretend play. By
        preschool, children also begin to incorporate more emotional and affective functions into their friendships.
        Preschool friends express more positive affect toward each other and score higher on measures of mutual liking,
        closeness, and loyalty than nonfriends do. Moreover, even young children frequently become sad or lonely when a
        friend moves away.</p>
