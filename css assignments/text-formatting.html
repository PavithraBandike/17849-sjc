    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Text-Align</h1>
    <p>Alignment refers to the text’s position within the text box. Typically, the default settings align the text
        horizontally to the left and vertically to the top. The text’s horizontal alignment (left, center, right) can be
        adjusted separately from its vertical alignment (top, middle, or bottom).

    </p>
    <h1 style="text-decoration:underline">Text-Decoration</h1>
    <p>Text decorations are drawn across descendant text elements. This means that if an element specifies a text
        decoration, then a child element can't remove the decoration. For example, in the markup
    <p>This text has <em>some emphasized words</em> in it.</p>, the style rule p { text-decoration: underline; } would
    cause the entire paragraph to be underlined. The style rule em { text-decoration: none; } would not cause any
    change; the entire paragraph would still be underlined. However, the rule em { text-decoration: overline; } would
    cause a second decoration to appear on "some emphasized words".</p>
    <h1 style="text-transform: capitalize;">Text-Transform</h1>
    <p>The text-transform property takes into account language-specific case mapping rules such as the following:

        In Turkic languages, like Turkish (tr), Azerbaijani (az), Crimean Tatar (crh), Volga Tatar (tt), and Bashkir
        (ba), there are two kinds of i, with and without the dot, and two case pairings: i/İ and ı/I.
        In German (de), the ß becomes SS in uppercase.
        In Dutch (nl), the ij digraph becomes IJ, even with text-transform: capitalize, which only puts the first letter
        of a word in uppercase.
        In Greek (el), vowels lose their accent when the whole word is in uppercase (ά/Α), except for the disjunctive
        eta (ή/Ή). Also, diphthongs with an accent on the first vowel lose the accent and gain a diaeresis on the second
        vowel (άι/ΑΪ).</p>
