    <h2 class="h2">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The .class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute.

        To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class.

        You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">How To Use Class Selectors</h2>
    Now that we understand what a CSS class is and how it appears in the body section of an HTML file, let's take a look
    at how to use them. I've designed several websites, and this is my preferred step-by-step process.<br><br>
    <div class="div">
    <h3 > 1.Open up your HTML document. </h3>
    To use CSS classes, we actually don't start in our CSS code. Open your HTML document first in a code editor or in
    your website's backend.
    <h3>2.Locate or create the element you want to style.</h3>
    Next up, find the HTML element you want to style with a unique CSS class. This can be any HTML element, such as
    buttons, divs, paragraphs, headings, links, tables, and more.

    It also helps to locate the corresponding element in the front-end of your website, so that you can see your changes
    as you make them.
    <h3>3. Add the CSS class declaration to the opening tag of the HTML element. </h3>
    This step can technically come at any point in this process, but I personally prefer to add the CSS class to the
    opening tag right as I'm checking my HTML document. You could skip to the next step, however, and add the class
    after you're done
