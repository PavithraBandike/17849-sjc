    <h2 style="color:darkgreen" >Introduction</h2>
    <p>CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a design language that enhances the appearance of a website by making it more appealing than plain or uninteresting text. </p>
    <p>Inline CSS is the technique to define the single element with the insert style sheets in an HTML document. We can add CSS in three approaches: Inline, Internal, and External.

        It has the interactive and unique style to create a single HTML element; we can define the inline CSS on the style attribute.</p>
    <h2 style="color:darkgreen">Disadvantages of Inline CSS</h2>
            <ul style="border: 3px solid; background-color: antiquewhite;"><li>Adding inline CSS rules to each HTML element is time-consuming and gives messy results on the HTML page.</li>
           <li> Implementing multiple styling elements can affect the HTML page's size and download time.</li>
            <li>It provides different versions such as CSS, CSS 1, CSS 2, and CSS 3, which can be confusing for developers to make decisions about which version they need to refer to and can give the wrong result in the web browser.</li>
           <li> Fragmentation: It gives the browser an incompatibility issue, i.e., it may work with one browser and may not work on another type of browser.</li></ul>
