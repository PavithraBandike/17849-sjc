        <h1>About Dogs</h1>
    </center>
    <p>Dog, (Canis lupus familiaris), domestic mammal of the family Canidae (order Carnivora). It is a subspecies of the
        gray wolf (Canis lupus) and is related to foxes and jackals. The dog is one of the two most ubiquitous and most
        popular domestic animals in the world (the cat is the other). For more than 12,000 years it has lived with
        humans as a hunting companion, protector, object of scorn or adoration, and friend.
<br><br>
        The dog evolved from the gray wolf into more than 400 distinct breeds. Human beings have played a major role in
        creating dogs that fulfill distinct societal needs. Through the most rudimentary form of genetic engineering,
        dogs were bred to accentuate instincts that were evident from their earliest encounters with humans. Although
        details about the evolution of dogs are uncertain, the first dogs were hunters with keen senses of sight and
        smell. Humans developed these instincts and created new breeds as need or desire arose.
<br><br>
        Dogs are regarded differently in different parts of the world. Characteristics of loyalty, friendship,
        protectiveness, and affection have earned dogs an important position in Western society, and in the United
        States and Europe the care and feeding of dogs has become a multibillion-dollar business. Western civilization
        has given the relationship between human and dog great importance, but, in some of the developing nations and in
        many areas of Asia, dogs are not held in the same esteem. In some areas of the world, dogs are used as guards or
        beasts of burden or even for food, whereas in the United States and Europe dogs are protected and admired. In
        ancient Egypt during the days of the pharaohs, dogs were considered to be sacred.</p>
